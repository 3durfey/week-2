# Week 2

The goal of this lab is to give you the tools you need to start building robust functions which can make useful calculations on large datasets.

To that end, we'll cover the following:

- More Python Basics
- Loops
- Generator Iterators
- NumPy
- NumPy Arrays
- Array Operations

## setup

*(As of April 2025)*

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository.
2. [Create a Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository) for your forked repository (this may take a few minutes to load at first). Use the codespace to make changes to the code, and to test the web app.
3. Once you're ready, commit and push your final changes to your repository.
4. Test your code by submitting your forked repository [to the Gradescope autograder](https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/21865616724749-Submitting-a-Code-assignment) on Canvas.
