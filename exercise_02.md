## Exercise

Given enough pennies (1 cent) and nickels (5 cents), write a function which calculates the number of ways you can make change for a given amount of cents. Do this in two ways:

1. Write the function `ways(n)` which does this without using NumPy.
2. Write *another* function `ways_np(n)` which does the same thing, but uses NumPy.

In the *apputil* file, add `ways(n)` and `ways_np(n)` accordingly to return the number of ways to yield `n` cents using only pennies and nickels.
